                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <hr>
            <p>This book is an introduction to the young and fast-growing field of data mining (also known
                as knowledge discovery from data, or KDD for short).</p> he book focuses on fundamental
                    data mining concepts and techniques for discovering interesting patterns from data in
                    various applications. In particular, we emphasize prominent techniques for developing
                    effective, efficient, and scalable data mining tools.<p>This chapter is organized as follows. In Section 1.1, you will learn why data mining is
                        in high demand and how it is part of the natural evolution of information technology.
                        Section 1.2 defines data mining with respect to the knowledge discovery process. Next,
                        you will learn about data mining from many aspects, such as the kinds of data that can
                        be mined (Section 1.3), the kinds of knowledge to be mined (Section 1.4), the kinds of
                        technologies to be used (Section 1.5), and targeted applications (Section 1.6). In this
                        way, you will gain a multidimensional view of data mining. Finally, Section 1.7 outlines
                        major data mining research and development issues.</p>
<p><b>1.1 Why Data Mining? </b> </p>
    <p> <i>Necessity, who is the mother of invention. – Plato</i> 
    We live in a world where vast amounts of data are collected daily.</p>

                <p>society, science and engineering, medicine, and almost every other aspect of daily life.</p>
<p>This explosive growth of available data volume is a result of the computerization of
    our society and the fast development of powerful data collection and storage tools.</p>
<p>Businesses worldwide generate gigantic data sets, including sales transactions, stock
    trading records, product descriptions, sales promotions, company profiles and performance,
    and customer feedback. For example, large stores, such as Wal-Mart, handle
    hundreds of millions of transactions per week at thousands of branches around the
    world. Scientific and engineering practices generate high orders of petabytes of data in
    a continuous manner, from remote sensing, process measuring, scientific experiments,
    system performance, engineering observations, and environment surveillance.</p>
 <p>Global backbone telecommunication networks carry tens of petabytes of data traffic
    every day. The medical and health industry generates tremendous amounts of data from
    medical records, patient monitoring, and medical imaging.</p><p>Billions of Web searches
        supported by search engines process tens of petabytes of data daily. Communities and
        social media have become increasingly important data sources, producing digital pictures
        and videos, blogs, Web communities, and various kinds of social networks. The
        list of sources that generate huge amounts of data is endless.</p>
This explosively growing, widely available.

                    having a closer look at attributes and data values. Real-world data are typically noisy,
                    enormous in volume (often several gigabytes or more), and may originate froma hodgepodge
                    of heterogenous sources. This chapter is about getting familiar with your data.
                    Knowledge about your data is useful for data preprocessing (see Chapter 3),</p><p>This chapter is organized as follows. In Section 1.1, you will learn why data mining is
                        in high demand and how it is part of the natural evolution of information technology.
                        Section 1.2 defines data mining with respect to the knowledge discovery process. Next,

                        be mined (Section 1.3)</p>
<p><b>1.1 Why Data Mining? </b> </p>
    <p> <i>“So what can we learn about our data that’s helpful in data preprocessing?”</i> 
        We begin in Section 2.1 by studying the various attribute types. These include nominal attributes.</p>


            </div>
            <div class="right-book2">
                <p><b>Nominal Attributes</b> </p>
<p>Nominal means “relating to names.” The values of a nominal attribute are symbols or
    names of things. Each value represents some kind of category, code, or state, and so nominal
    attributes are also referred to as categorical.</p>
<p>Both hair color and marital status
    are nominal attributes. Another example of a nominal attribute is occupation, with the
    values teacher, dentist, programmer, farmer, and so on.</p>
 <p>Because nominal attribute values do not have any meaningful order about them and
    are not quantitative, it makes no sense to find the mean (average) value or median
    (middle) value for such an attribute, given a set of objects. One thing that is of interest,
    however, is the attribute’s most commonly occurring value.</p>
    Interval-scaled attributes are measured on a scale of equal-size units. The values of
    interval-scaled attributes have order and can be positive, 0, or negative. Thus, in addition
    to providing a ranking of values, such attributes allow us to compare and quantify the
    difference between values.
